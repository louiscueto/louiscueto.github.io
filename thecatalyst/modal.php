					<p style="font-size: .85rem;">Leaders need to evolve their way of thinking and understanding issues of increasing complexity in their businesses and in the contexts their businesses operate in. This is a growing imperative for them to remain competitive and certainly if they intend to grow.</p>
					<p style="font-size: .85rem;">Companies' systems and processes are more typically designed for a very predictable world. Increasingly the complex challenges businesses face are not predictable, often quite abruptly so, and the unfolding challenges are often ambiguous as well.</p>
					<p style="font-size: .85rem;">It is not enough for leaders to improve just their leadership capabilities, they also need to simultaneously change how their organizations are designed and operate to thrive and eventually excel in complexity. This change involves modifying norms and behaviors, changing policies and procedures, and implementing programs, systems and technologies that can enable and support these modifications.</p>
					<p style="font-size: .85rem;">The Catalyst Asia group can advise and partner with leaders who want to transform their leadership approach to make themselves in to leaders who can thrive in complexity. We also advise and partner with leaders who are also ready to change their organizations to become complexity friendly as well.</p>
					<p style="font-size: .85rem;">Catalyst Asia partners with leaders to first assess their existing leadership capabilities to determine how adaptive they are in the face of complex challenges. Catalyst Asia can then guide leaders or leadership teams to change their leadership mindset, approach and dynamics to be optimally suited for their complex environment.</p>
					<p style="font-size: .85rem;">Catalyst Asia also supports leaders to apply their newly realized ways of leadership to how their companies are organized and operate, readying the organization to succeed in complexity. Support typically takes the form of diagnosing the organization's needed design changes and facilitating change programs to position their companies to execute in ways adapted to rapid and/or unexpected change, evolving customer expectations and needs, shifting employee demographics, new technologies, disruptive innovations, and regional or global competition.</p>
